# Scripts of Conventional Molecular Dynamics Simulation For Gromacs

## 
There are three scripts by which we can execute two-stage energy minimisation, NVT and NPT equilibrium simulations, 
and production runs. 

1. `bash 01_prepMD.sh [input pdb file]`
2. `bash 02_eq.sh [run id (unsigned integer)]`
3. `bash 03_md_prod.sh [run id]`
4. `bash 0x_ramd_prod.sh [run id]`
